      <center>Welcome to Linux Command-Line Essentials!</center><br>

      This guide covers key Linux file operations and compression commands like find, tar, gzip, gunzip, and zip, essential for managing files and directories efficiently. You'll also learn about file permissions with chmod, chown, and chgrp, plus process monitoring with ps. Mastering these commands will boost your confidence in navigating and managing files in Linux. Let's dive in!

         <p>
            gzip command compresses files. Each single file is compressed into a single file. The compressed file consists of a GNU zip header and deflated data. If given a file as an argument, gzip compresses the file, adds a “.gz” suffix, and deletes the original file. With no arguments, gzip compresses the standard input and writes the compressed file to the standard output.

        <h2>gunzip Command</h2>
        <p>
          The gunzip command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the gzip compression utility. It restores the original content of the compressed files by removing the .gz extension. This command is commonly used in Unix-based systems to reduce file sizes for storage or transmission, and it can handle single files or multiple files simultaneously when used with wildcards. By default, gunzip deletes the compressed file after successful decompression, but this behavior can be modified with the -c option to keep the original file.</p>

        <h2>zip Command</h2>
        Zip is used to compress files to reduce file size and is also used as a file package utility. Zip is available in many operating systems like Unix, Linux, windows, etc.If you have limited bandwidth between two servers and want to transfer the files faster, then zip the files and transfer them.
            <br>
        Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 is common for text files. zip has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without compression. zip automatically chooses the better of the two for each file to be compressed. The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution, archiving files, and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.<br>

        <h2>chmod Command</h2>
        Linux chmod command is used to change the access permissions of files and directories. It stands for change mode. It can not change the permission of symbolic links. Even, it ignores the symbolic links come across recursive directory traversal.

        In the Linux file system, each file is associated with a particular owner and have permission access for different users. The user classes may be:
        <ul>
        <li>owner</li>
        <li>group member</li>
        <li>Others (Everybody else)</li>
      </ul><br>
        The file permissions in Linux are the following three types:
        <ul>
       <li>read (r)</li> 
        <li>write (w)</li>
        <li>execute (x)</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Root User: It is a superuser who has access to all the directories and files in our system and it can perform any operation. An important thing to note is that only the root user can perform changing of permissions or ownerships of the files that are not owned by them.</li>

        <h2>ps Command</h2>
        <p>
          The `ps` command, which stands for “process status,” is like a computer tool that helps you see what’s happening inside your Linux computer. Imagine your computer is doing several things simultaneously, like running different programs or apps. These are the processes and the `ps` command lets you take a quick look at them. When you use it without any special instructions, it shows you the processes that are connected to the window or screen you are currently using. But here’s where it gets interesting: you can make the ps command show you exactly what you want to know by giving it special instructions, called options. These options let you customize the information you see, like finding out which programs are using the most computer power or checking what a specific user is doing. So, while it can give you a basic overview, the ps command’s real strength is in letting you choose exactly what details you want to see about the processes on your computer.
